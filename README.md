# Task 2 - Data Visualization & Storytelling

## Overview
This task was about mastering **visual storytelling** using charts and dashboards.
I used the **Superstore dataset** and built a dashboard in **Power BI**.

## Files
- `data/Superstore_Cleaned.csv` → Cleaned dataset (ready for analysis)
- `workbook/Superstores Sales.pbix` → Power BI dashboard file
- `notebook/Superstore_Cleaning.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook for cleaning

## Dashboard Highlights
- KPIs: Total Sales, Total Profit, Orders, Avg Order Value
- Sales Trend over Time
- Sales & Profit by Category and Sub-Category
- Profit vs Sales scatter to spot low-margin products
- Map view of Sales by Region/State
- Top 10 Products and Customers

## Key Insights
1. [Write one finding, e.g., Office Supplies is high sales but low profit]
2. [Another insight, e.g., Technology has strong profit margin]
3. [One actionable step, e.g., Focus discount strategy on low-profit categories]

## Tools Used
- **Power BI** for dashboard
- **Python (pandas)** for cleaning
- **GitHub** for version control
